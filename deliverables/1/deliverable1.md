# CS/COE 1530 - Software Engineering
Spring Semester 2017

## DUE DATE: 1 FEB 2017

## Deliverable 1

For the first sprint, each group will need to:

1. Determine initial user stories for the project, including prioritization
2. Write a walking skeleton and prototype UI of the application using gradle, which should include unit tests 
3. Write about the various decisions that the group came to, and how they did so

The team should determine the Scrum Master for this first sprint.  The Scrum Master will change each sprint.

## Format

For the first sprint, you will turn in:

1. A cover page, in the format described below
2. A backlog of user stories, ranked by prioritization (highest priority first)
3. A description of decisions made in the sprint
3. A "walking skeleton" application available on GitHub or GitLab (ADD ME AS A COLLABORATOR!  Username on either site is "laboon").  This should include a basic UI of the program - note that this does not need to have any functionality asociated with it, and it may change in the future.

Each of these paper sections shall be CLEARLY MARKED (i.e. they should each have titles and start on their own page).

Format for cover page:
* The title "*your team name* - SPRINT 1 DELIVERABLE"
* The names of the people in the group, and their GitHub or GitLab username.  Mark down who the Scrum Master is this sprint, e.g. "Jane Doe (Scrum Master)"
* The date that it is due (1 FEB 2017)

## Grading
* User Stories and Ranking: 25% of grade
* Walking Skeleton: 50% of grade
* Description of Decisions: 25% of grade

User stories shall be in the Connextra template ("As a.. I want.. so that..") and provide good, user-level descriptions of user needs and wants.  User stories should be printed in order of priority.  It is NOT expected that you will complete every single user story, or even that these are the final versions of the user story; they may change and be prioritized differently as the sprints go on.

User stories should flow from the needs of the customer.  Your discussions with the customer should guide the user stories themselves as well as their prioritization.

The number of user stories will vary based on the project, but it should be at least eight at the VERY minimum.  If there are fewer than eight stories, the project may be too small or your user stories too big.

The walking skeleton __must__ compile and show a basic UI for the application.  It should follow the general outline of a walking skeleton as discussed in GOOSGBT (specifically, it should .  You can have more functionality if you like, but it is essential that your program compiles, runs and displays a basic UI without error!

The walking skeleton __must__ be able to run on __everybody's__ computer!  Everybody should have access to the repository on GitHub and able to make commits by the end of this sprint.

The description of decisions should be, at an absolute minimum, one page of text.  It should include any background research you did on the domain, your interactions with the customer, and your team's opinions on prioritization.  Be sure to include any __disagreement__ your team had internally!  Software engineering is rarely without some sort of disagreement about the direction of the software. 

The description of decisions should also indicate what you think is effective and ineffective during this sprint, and what you plan to do about these going forward.  For example, stand-ups took up too much time so we're shortening them, people were stepping over each other's code so the team is going to use a different branching model, etc.  This concept of continuous improvement is important to the Scrum methodology.

Yes, grammar and spelling count.  Points will be deducted for more than one grammatical or spelling error per section.  Yes, this is important.

The needs of the user/customer (i.e., Bill Laboon) will be determined in class by interviewing the user/customer (once again, i.e., Bill Laboon).

## The Game

In this class, we are going to make a Java version of the ancient Norse game, hnefatafl("table of the fist", in Old Norse).  We will play by Copenhagen rules - that is, an 11 x 11 square board, and the king must reach a corner to win.  Rules for the game can be found here: http://aagenielsen.dk/copenhagen_rules.php.

We will start by allowing player vs player on the same computer.  Future functionality may include playing the computer (AI), playing by email (correspondence), or via a server.

There should be a way to save and load games locally.

Further details on what other features, functionality, etc. may be found by interviewing the customer/user during the stakeholder interaction exercise.

## Other

Please feel free to email me or come to office hours to discuss any problems you have.
