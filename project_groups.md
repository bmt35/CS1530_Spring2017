## Project Groups

Please add your name to a group using a PR.  Be sure you come up with a name for your software company/group and provide a slogan or talk of your group's programming philosophy.  You may choose an already-existing group if it has fewer than four members.  Or you may create your own group.

If you don't know how to issue a PR, please see the file how_to_sign_up.md in this directory for detailed instructions.
